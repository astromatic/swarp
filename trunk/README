Swarp is a program that resamples and coadd FITS images to any arbitrary
astrometric projection recognized by the WCS standard (see
http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/wcs.html)

This file describes shortly the SYNTAX of Swarp.
See INSTALL for instructions about install.
For more information, please refer to the documentation
(see http://astromatic.net/software/swarp)

The general SYNTAX is similar to that of SExtractor:

% swarp [<fits_file1>, <fits_file2>,...] [-c <Configuration_file>]
        [-<keyword> <value>] ...

- Keyword parameters given in the command line override those from the
  configuration file.
- If the list-file is given as unique argument, Swarp looks for a
  default configuration file called ``default.swarp''. If no configuration
  file is available, swarp uses internal defaults.
- Swarp creates 2 FITS files in output: the coadded image and its
  "weight-map" (coverage map).
- FITS headers (any FITS image, or even an ASCII dump, ended by "END     ")
  can be provided in addition to the input images. They must be in the same
  directory and have the same name except for the ".fits" suffix which must
  be replaced by ".head". This suffix can be changed using the HEAD_SUFFIX
  configuration parameter. External ASCII headers for multiextension FITS files
  are allowed: simply, each extension header section must be ended by the
  "END     " keyword.

% swarp -d

prints a default configuration file on the standard output
